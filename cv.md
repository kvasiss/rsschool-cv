I'm a student from Belarus, I'm studying in Poland at a technical school now. I don't have work experience, but I strive to learn a lot of new things that can help me in the future and present. I'm very purposeful, punctual and responsible. 

 I don’t know any programming languages ​​yet, but I want to learn code in JavaScript.
